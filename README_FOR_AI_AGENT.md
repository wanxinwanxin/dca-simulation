## 🚨 TO CLEAN UP

### Test File Naming Issues
Current test files don't follow pytest conventions:
- `tests/test_market_orders_gbm_simulation.py` (27KB) - Actually a simulation script, not unit tests
- `tests/test_dutch_orders_gbm_simulation.py` (18KB) - Actually a simulation script, not unit tests  
- `tests/generate_gbm_fan_analysis.py` - Analysis script, not a test

**Action needed**: Move these to `scripts/` or rename appropriately

### Blueprint Compliance Issues
- **Hypothesis testing**: Dependency exists but no property tests implemented
- **Test coverage**: No actual unit tests for core components
- **Golden regression**: No deterministic regression testing

### Potential Technical Issues
- **Test utils coupling**: Some test utilities tightly coupled to specific engine implementations
- **Configuration drift**: YAML configs may not match all available parameters
- **Documentation**: Limited inline documentation in some modules

### Previous Critical Changes (Earlier December 2024):
- 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Completely rewrote SingleDutchOrderStrategy to actually implement declining Dutch auctions
- ✅ **Continuous Limit Updates**: Dutch orders now properly update limit price through cancel/replace operations
- ✅ **Proper Order Lifecycle**: Added state tracking for order start time and last limit price updates
- ✅ **Dynamic Pricing**: Orders now fill at the current declining limit, not the original static limit
- ✅ **Expiry Handling**: Proper cancellation of expired Dutch orders
- 🎨 **Enhanced Dutch Order Visualization**: Added declining limit price visualization to execution charts
- ✅ **Declining Limit Price Line**: Shows the decaying limit price curve during Dutch order lifetime with red dashed line

- ✅ **Dutch-Specific Chart Title**: Enhanced chart titles to indicate Dutch auction with declining limit price
- 🔍 **Fill Intersection Verification**: Added comprehensive verification analysis for Dutch order fill logic
- ✅ **Intersection Detection**: Analyzes whether fill occurred at first intersection of declining limit with market price
- ✅ **Verification Status Display**: Pass/Warning/Fail status with detailed reasoning for each Dutch order execution
- ✅ **Crossing Logic Explanation**: Detailed breakdown of buy/sell crossing thresholds and verification calculations
- ✅ **Multiple Intersection Handling**: Proper analysis when multiple intersections occur during order lifetime
- 🗑️ **Removed Price Improvement vs Limit Metric**: Cleaned up Dutch order metrics display (changed from 4 to 3 columns)

### Technical Details:
- **Critical Strategy Rewrite**: SingleDutchOrderStrategy now implements proper cancel/replace order management
- **Continuous Updates**: Orders update limit price every time step when price changes by >0.1 cents
- **State Management**: Tracks order start time, last limit price, and order lifecycle properly
- **Dynamic Limit Calculation**: `get_current_limit_price()` now uses order start time, not creation time
- **Expiry Logic**: Proper handling of order expiration based on duration parameter
- **Declining Limit Visualization**: Calculates limit price at 1-second intervals during order lifetime for smooth curve
- **Side Detection**: Determines buy/sell from implementation shortfall calculation pattern
- **Intersection Logic**: For sells: `limit ≤ mid - spread`, for buys: `limit ≥ mid + spread`
- **Verification Algorithm**: Scans entire order lifetime to find all intersection points with spread thresholds
- **Timing Analysis**: Compares actual fill time with first theoretical intersection time
- **Multi-Intersection Detection**: Identifies cases where multiple intersections occur (rare but possible)
- **Spread Integration**: Uses same 0.01 spread constant as simulation for consistency

### Issues Resolved:
- **🚨 CRITICAL: Static Limit Bug**: Dutch orders were placing static orders that never updated - completely broken auction behavior
- **🚨 Execution at Wrong Price**: Orders were filling at starting limit instead of current declining limit
- **🚨 Massive Implementation Shortfall**: 5000+ bps shortfalls due to static limit pricing
- **🚨 Strategy-Engine Mismatch**: SingleDutchOrderStrategy didn't match DutchAwareMatchingEngine expectations
- **Missing Limit Price Visualization**: Dutch orders now show the critical declining limit price that determines fills
- **Unclear Fill Logic**: Users can now visually verify that fills occur at proper intersections
- **No Verification Feedback**: Added comprehensive verification analysis with pass/fail status
- **Limited Dutch Understanding**: Enhanced UI provides complete picture of Dutch auction mechanics
- **Intersection Ambiguity**: Clear visual and analytical confirmation of first intersection fill logic

### Previous Updates:
**Default Impact Model Switch (Earlier December 2024):**
- 🔄 **Switched Default Impact Model**: Changed from RealisticImpact to PercentageImpact as the default impact model
- ✅ **Enhanced YAML Support**: Added PercentageImpact to the factory registry for YAML configurations
- ✅ **Price-Proportional Impact**: Default now uses percentage-based impact that scales with price level
- ✅ **Maintained Bid-Ask Handling**: PercentageImpact already includes proper bid-ask spread handling

### Technical Details:
- **Default Impact Model**: `PercentageImpact` with `spread=0.05` and `gamma=0.001` (0.1% impact per unit)
- **Impact Formula**: `impact = γ * qty * mid_price` (scales with price level)
- **Market Orders**: `(mid ± spread) ± γ·qty·mid` (bid-ask spread + percentage impact)
- **Limit Orders**: `mid ± γ·qty·mid` (percentage impact only, spread already crossed)
- **Registry Update**: Added `"PercentageImpact": PercentageImpact` to `src/config/factory.py`

### Previous Updates:
**Order Creation Time Bug Fix (Earlier December 2024):**
- 🔧 **Fixed Order Creation Time Bug**: Market order creation time slider now works correctly
- ✅ **Timing Implementation**: Replaced MarketOrderStrategy with ConfigurableStrategy for proper absolute timing
- ✅ **User Control**: Order creation time slider now actually affects when the order is placed in simulation
- ✅ **Accurate Results**: Order creation timing now properly reflected in execution metrics and visualization

### Issues Resolved:
- **Order Creation Time Slider Ineffective**: Previously market orders were always placed at time 0 regardless of slider value
- **Implementation vs Display**: This was an implementation problem, not a display problem - the timing parameter wasn't being used correctly
- **Strategy Selection**: MarketOrderStrategy was designed for multiple orders at intervals, not single orders at specific times

### Technical Details:
- Root cause: `MarketOrderStrategy` places first order at `current_index * interval = 0 * interval = 0` (always time 0)
- Solution: Replaced `MarketOrderStrategy` with `ConfigurableStrategy` using order specification with absolute "time" field
- Updated `run_single_order_simulation()` to create proper order spec with `"time": order_timing` parameter
- ConfigurableStrategy correctly handles absolute timing: `clock >= order_spec.get("time", 0)`

### Previous Updates:
**Dutch Order Support Added to Phase 1.5:**
- 🔄 **Added Dutch Order Support**: Implemented single Dutch auction order execution in Phase 1.5
- ✅ **Order Type Selection**: Added UI toggle between Market Orders and Dutch Auction Orders

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FOR ALL FUTURE AGENTS ⚠️

### 🔄 KEEPING THIS DOCUMENT UPDATED IS REQUIRED

**🚨 CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP**: Every AI agent MUST update this document when making ANY changes to the codebase. This is not optional.

**❌ COMMON AGENT FAILURE**: Many agents have failed to update this README, leaving it outdated and useless for future development. DO NOT BE ONE OF THEM.

**✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS**: Future agents MUST update this document when making changes:

1. **After implementing missing components**:
   - Move items from "❌ MISSING" to "✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED" 
   - Update status descriptions
   - Add new capabilities to "What Actually Works"

2. **After adding new features**:
   - Add to "🔍 MAJOR EXTENSIONS" section
   - Describe the new functionality and benefits
   - Update development workflow if needed

3. **After fixing issues**:
   - Remove items from "🚨 TO CLEAN UP"
   - Update technical status
   - Document resolved issues

4. **When finding new issues**:
   - Add to "🚨 TO CLEAN UP" with specific action items
   - Document impact and priority
   - Note any workarounds in place

**🔥 ENFORCEMENT**: If you implement code changes without updating this README, you have failed the user and made the project harder for future agents. Always update documentation as part of your implementation.

### 📝 UPDATE TEMPLATE

```

### 🎯 PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

For future agents working on this codebase:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY** (Blueprint compliance)
   - Implement `adaptive_limit.py` strategy
   - Implement `slippage.py` probe  
   - Add proper unit tests for core components
   - Add Hypothesis property testing

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Infrastructure)
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Add golden regression tests
   - Fix test file organization

3. **LOW PRIORITY** (Enhancements)
   - Extend visualization capabilities
   - Add more sophisticated market models
   - Performance optimizations

### 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

When adding new components:
1. **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Property tests**: Use Hypothesis for invariant checking
4. **Regression tests**: Ensure deterministic behavior
5. **Performance tests**: Validate simulation speed

### 🔍 DEBUGGING TIPS

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Configuration errors**: Check `src/config/factory.py` registry
2. **Import issues**: Verify `__init__.py` files in all directories  
3. **SimPy timing**: Check environment advancement in engines
4. **Random state**: Ensure reproducible seeding for deterministic tests
5. **Memory usage**: Monitor large multi-path simulations

## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS FOR AI AGENTS

### **Priority 1: Start with MVP Streamlit App**
1. **Create Basic UI Structure**: Set up `streamlit_app/` directory with initial main.py
2. **GBM Price Path Explorer**: Implement volatility slider and path count selector
3. **Real-time Visualization**: Connect to existing GBM implementation for live updates
4. **Path Persistence**: Add save/load functionality for generated price paths

### **Success Criteria for Phase 1**
- [ ] Working Streamlit app accessible via `streamlit run streamlit_app/main.py`
- [ ] Interactive controls: volatility (0.01-0.20), path count (1-100), fixed parameters
- [ ] Real-time chart updates when parameters change
- [ ] Save paths to session state and export to JSON files
- [ ] Basic statistics display (mean, std, min/max across paths)

### **Key Implementation Notes**
- **Leverage Existing Code**: Use `src/market/gbm.py` and `src/test_utils/` framework
- **Start Simple**: Single page app first, expand to multi-page later
- **Focus on UX**: Immediate visual feedback for all parameter changes
- **Build Incrementally**: Each checkpoint adds specific functionality

### **Supervisor Checkpoints**
1. **After MVP**: Validate basic GBM explorer functionality and UX
2. **After Strategy Integration**: Review workflow for strategy execution
3. **After Parameter Sweeps**: Validate sensitivity analysis interface
4. **After Advanced Features**: Production readiness assessment

**🎯 FINAL REMINDER FOR ALL AGENTS**: This document is a living guide that MUST be kept accurate. Every code change requires a documentation update. The codebase has evolved significantly beyond the original blueprint - document both what exists and what's still needed.

**📋 POST-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] README_FOR_AI_AGENT.md updated with new capabilities
- [ ] Status sections moved from ❌ to ✅ as appropriate  
- [ ] "Recent Changes" section updated with your contribution
- [ ] "What Actually Works" section reflects new functionality

**Failure to complete this checklist means incomplete work.**
